│  Context: This chunk details provisions regarding termination of             │
│  employment, specifically outlining criteria for ending service due to       │
│  disability or unfitness, including compensation and the calculation of      │
│  service periods for retirement and end-of-service benefits. It connects to  │
│  the broader framework established in the Human Resources Regulation by      │
│  defining the conditions under which an employee’s service can be            │
│  terminated, impacting their eligibility for benefits and contributing to    │
│  the overall management of the workforce within government authorities.      │
│                                                                              │

│  - a. Subject to the relevant provisions of the Retirement Pensions and      │
│  Benefits Law in force in the Emirate, the employee's service shall end if   │
│  their total disability or unfitness for service is proven, in accordance    │
│  with a report issued by the competent medical committee.                    │
│  - b. The date of the employee's termination of service shall be determined  │
│  as of the date of issuance of the report of the competent medical           │
│  committee.                                                                  │
│  - c. The period spent by the employee who continues to serve during the     │
│  period from the date of issuance of the report of the competent medical     │
│  committee until the date of  issuance of the decision to terminate their    │
│  service by the competent authority shall not be counted within their        │
│  actual  service  for  the  purposes  of  retirement  for  citizens  or      │
│  end-of-service  benefits  for  noncitizens. The employee's salaries during  │
│  this period are considered wages for work, and for the citizen employee,    │
│  the contributions deducted from their salary for the benefit of the         │
│  retirement fund shall be returned to them.                                  │
│  - d. The government authority may not terminate the service of an employee  │
│  with a disability for unfitness for service due to their stable health      │
│  condition when they were appointed.                                         │
